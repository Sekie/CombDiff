This is a quick C++ script to compute positive combination difference assignments.

The input file is a single column of frequencies that must be user created. To use the program, one must input the three relative energies of the transitions. If only two relative energies are to be checked, then enter -1 for the third energy. An output file is created listing all positive matches.
